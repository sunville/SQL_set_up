   ![New Connection](images/new_connection.png)

2. **Configure Basic Connection Settings**:
   - **Connection Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your connection
   - **Database File**: Choose the SQLite database file path:
     - Click the "..." button to browse for an existing database file
     - Or enter the file path directly
   - **Mode**: Choose "Normal" for most operations
   - **SQLite version**: Typically auto-detected, but you can specify if needed

3. **Configure Advanced Settings** (Optional):
   - Click the "Advanced" tab for additional options
   - **Encoding**: Set character encoding (default is UTF-8)
   - **Foreign Key Constraints**: Enable to enforce foreign key constraints
   - **Journal Mode**: Set the journal mode (WAL recommended for performance)
   - **Auto-vacuum**: Configure automatic database cleanup

4. **Save Your Connection**:
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify settings
   - Click "OK" to save the connection

## Connection Properties

Understanding SQLite connection properties helps optimize your database usage:

| Property | Description | Recommended Setting |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Connection Name | Identifier for the connection | Descriptive name based on purpose |
| Database File | Path to the SQLite file | Full path to your .db/.sqlite file |
| Mode | Connection access mode | Normal for standard use, Read Only when needed |
| Encoding | Character encoding | UTF-8 (handles international characters) |
| Foreign Keys | Enforce referential integrity | Enabled (provides data integrity) |
| Journal Mode | How transactions are logged | WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) for performance |
| Busy Timeout | Time to wait for locked database | 5000 (milliseconds) for shared databases |
| Cache Size | Memory used for database cache | Depends on available RAM (1000-10000) |
| Page Size | Size of database pages | 4096 (bytes) for most applications |

## Testing Your Connection

Always test your connection before using it extensively:

1. **Using the Test Button**:
   - In the connection dialog, click "Test Connection"
   - Navicat will attempt to open the database file
   - You'll see "Connection successful" if everything is configured correctly
   
   ![Test Connection](images/test_connection.png)

2. **Common Test Issues**:
   - File not found: Check the database path
   - Permission denied: Verify file access permissions
   - Database is locked: Check if another process is using the file
   - Corrupt database: The database file may be damaged

3. **Checking Connection Details**:
   - After creating the connection, right-click it and select "Connection Properties"
   - Review all settings for accuracy
   - Check the "General" tab to verify the database path

## Opening an Existing Database

Once your connection is set up, you can open and work with the database:

1. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Double-click the connection in the Navicat sidebar
   - Or right-click the connection and select "Open Connection"
   - Navicat will load the database structure

2. **Browse Database Objects**:
   - Navigate through tables, views, and other objects in the sidebar
   - Double-click any object to open and view its data or structure
   - Use the "Design" tab to view and modify object structure

3. **View Connection Information**:
   - Right-click on the connection and select "Connection Information"
   - View database statistics, version, and other details
   - Check database size and other properties

## Creating a New Database

You can create new SQLite databases directly from Navicat:

1. **Create a New Database File**:
   - Click "Connection" in the toolbar
   - Select "SQLite"
   - In the "Database File" field, enter a path for your new database
   - Click "..." and navigate to where you want to save the database
   - Enter a filename with .db or .sqlite extension
   - Click "OK" to create the database

2. **First Steps with Your New Database**:
   - Create tables by right-clicking on "Tables" and selecting "New Table"
   - Define schemas using the table designer
   - Import data from various formats
   - Create indexes, views, and other objects

3. **Setting Database Properties**:
   - Right-click on the connection and select "Connection Properties"
   - Go to the "Advanced" tab
   - Configure journal mode, page size, and other SQLite-specific settings

## Managing Multiple Connections

As your projects grow, you might need to manage multiple SQLite connections:

1. **Organizing Connections**:
   - Create connection groups by right-clicking in the connection pane and selecting "New Group"
   - Drag and drop connections into groups
   - Rename groups to reflect their purpose (e.g., "Development", "Production")
   
   ![Connection Groups](images/connection_groups.png)

2. **Color-Coding Connections**:
   - Right-click a connection and select "Edit Connection"
   - Click the colored box in the "General" tab
   - Choose a color to visually identify different connections
   - This helps distinguish development, testing, and production databases

3. **Exporting/Importing Connection Settings**:
   - Export: File → Export Connections → Select connections → Save file
   - Import: File → Import Connections → Select file → Import
   - This facilitates sharing connection configurations between team members or computers

## Connection Security

Security considerations when working with SQLite databases:

1. **Encrypted Databases**:
   - Navicat supports SQLCipher encrypted databases
   - When connecting, check "Encrypted" and provide the password
   - Use strong passwords for sensitive data

2. **File Permissions**:
   - Ensure database files have appropriate filesystem permissions
   - Restrict access to only necessary users or applications
   - On shared systems, place database files in secure locations

3. **Network Access**:
   - Unlike client-server databases, SQLite files are accessed directly
   - For networked access, consider using shared folders with proper access controls
   - Be cautious when placing SQLite files on network drives (performance may degrade)

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

Common connection problems and their solutions:

### Database File Not Found

**Problem**: Navicat cannot locate the specified database file.

**Solution**:
- Verify the file path is correct and the file exists
- Check for typos in the file path
- Ensure you have proper access permissions to the folder
- Use absolute paths instead of relative paths

### Database is Locked

**Problem**: The database is locked by another process.

**Solution**:
- Close other applications that might be using the database
- Check if you have the database open in another Navicat instance
- Increase the "Busy Timeout" value in connection settings
- If using network drives, ensure proper file sharing settings

### Corrupt Database

**Problem**: The database file is corrupted or not a valid SQLite database.

**Solution**:
- Try to recover using SQLite's PRAGMA integrity_check
- Restore from a backup if available
- Use SQLite's dump and restore process to recover data:
  ```sql
  .output dump.sql
  .dump
  .exit
  ```
  Then create a new database and import:
  ```sql
  .read dump.sql
  ```

### Invalid Encoding

**Problem**: Character encoding issues cause garbled text or errors.

**Solution**:
- Set the correct encoding in connection properties
- For international characters, use UTF-8 encoding
- If importing data, ensure consistent encoding between source and destination

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow database operations, especially over network.

**Solution**:
- Enable Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) journal mode
- Increase cache size for better performance
- Avoid placing SQLite files on network drives
- Create appropriate indexes for frequent queries
