## Introduction to SQLite

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. A complete SQL database with multiple tables, indices, triggers, and views is contained in a single disk file.

Key features of SQLite:
- Serverless - No separate server process needed
- Zero-configuration - No setup or administration required
- Portable - The entire database is stored in a single file
- Small footprint - Minimal memory and disk space requirements
- Cross-platform - Works on virtually all operating systems

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, see the [SQLite Installation Guide](Installation/README.md).

SQLite is often pre-installed on many operating systems (including macOS and many Linux distributions). However, if you need to install it manually:

### Windows
1. Visit the [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
2. Download the precompiled binaries for Windows
   - "sqlite-tools-win32-x86-*.zip" (command line tools)
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\sqlite`)
4. Add this folder to your PATH environment variable:
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" > Properties > Advanced system settings
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Select "Path" from system variables and click "Edit"
   - Add the path to your SQLite folder (e.g., `C:\sqlite`)
   - Click "OK" to confirm changes

### macOS
If SQLite is not already installed, use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install sqlite
```

### Linux
For Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
wsl sudo apt update
wsl sudo apt install sqlite3
```

For Red Hat/Fedora:
```bash
wsl sudo dnf install sqlite
```

## Creating and Using SQLite Databases

For detailed instructions on database creation and operations, see the [Running SQLite Guide](Running_SQLite/README.md).

Unlike other database systems, SQLite doesn't require you to set up a server. You simply create or connect to a database file.

### Creating a New Database

Using the SQLite command line:

```bash
# Open SQLite with a new or existing database file
wsl sqlite3 mydatabase.db

# You'll see the SQLite prompt
sqlite>
```

### Basic Commands

```sql
-- Create a new table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com');

-- Query data
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Exit SQLite
.quit
```

### SQLite Special Commands

SQLite has special dot commands for various functions:

```
.help           Show help on commands
.tables         List all tables
.schema TABLE   Show the CREATE statement for TABLE
.mode column    Set output mode to columnar
.headers on     Turn display of headers on
.exit or .quit  Exit SQLite
```

## Connecting with Navicat

For detailed connection instructions and features, see the [Connecting with Navicat Guide](Connecting_with_Navicat/README.md).

1. **Install Navicat**:
   - Download and install Navicat from the [official website](https://www.navicat.com/en/download/navicat-for-sqlite).
   - Choose the edition that suits your needs (there's a free trial available).

2. **Create a New Connection**:
   - Launch Navicat
   - Click the "Connection" button in the top-left corner
   - Select "SQLite" as the connection type
   - Fill in the connection details:
     - Connection Name: Choose a meaningful name (e.g., "My SQLite Database")
     - Database File: Browse to select your SQLite database file (e.g., mydatabase.db)
     - For encrypted databases (if using SQLCipher), enter the password
   - Test the connection using the "Test Connection" button
   - Click "OK" to save the connection

3. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Double-click on your newly created connection in the left sidebar
   - Navicat will connect to the SQLite database and display all tables
