## Introduction to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL (often called "Postgres") is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development. It's known for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. PostgreSQL extends the SQL language and adds many features that safely store and scale complex data workloads.

Key features:
- Advanced SQL capabilities (Common Table Expressions, Window Functions)
- Support for JSON and other NoSQL features
- Robust transaction support (ACID compliance)
- Extensibility (custom data types, functions, operators)
- Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)
- Excellent support for geographic data with PostGIS extension

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, see the [PostgreSQL Installation Guide](Installation/README.md).

### Windows
1. Download the installer from [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard:
   - Choose components to install (Server, pgAdmin, Command Line Tools)
   - Choose installation directory
   - Set data directory
   - Set password for the database superuser (postgres)
   - Set port (default is 5432)
   - Choose locale
3. After installation, the PostgreSQL server will be set up as a Windows service

### macOS
Using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install postgresql
```

Or download the installer from [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/)

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
wsl sudo apt update
wsl sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

For Red Hat/Fedora:
```bash
wsl sudo dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
wsl sudo postgresql-setup --initdb
wsl sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

## Running PostgreSQL Server

For detailed server management instructions, see the [Running PostgreSQL Server Guide](Running_PostgreSQL_Server/README.md).

### Windows
PostgreSQL should run automatically as a Windows service after installation.
- To verify: Open Services (services.msc) and check if "postgresql-x64-XX" is running
- To start manually: `net start postgresql-x64-XX` (where XX is your version number)

### macOS
Start PostgreSQL using Homebrew:
```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

Or manually:
```bash
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
```

### Linux
```bash
wsl sudo systemctl start postgresql
wsl sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

## Connecting with Navicat

For detailed connection instructions and features, see the [Connecting with Navicat Guide](Connecting_with_Navicat/README.md).

1. **Install Navicat**:
   - Download and install Navicat from the [official website](https://www.navicat.com/en/download/navicat-for-postgresql).
   - Choose the edition that suits your needs (there's a free trial available).

2. **Create a New Connection**:
   - Launch Navicat
   - Click the "Connection" button in the top-left corner
   - Select "PostgreSQL" as the connection type
   - Fill in the connection details:
     - Connection Name: Choose a meaningful name (e.g., "Local PostgreSQL")
     - Host: localhost (or the server IP address)
     - Port: 5432 (default PostgreSQL port)
     - Initial Database: postgres (or your database name)
     - User Name: postgres (or your created username)
     - Password: Your PostgreSQL password
   - Click "Advanced" to configure additional PostgreSQL-specific settings (if needed)
   - Test the connection using the "Test Connection" button
   - Click "OK" to save the connection

3. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Double-click on your newly created connection in the left sidebar
   - Navicat will connect to the PostgreSQL server and display all databases
