## Connection Property Settings

In addition to basic connection information, Navicat provides many customizable connection properties:

| Property | Description | Example Values |
|------|------|--------|
| Connection Name | Name identifying the connection | Development-PostgreSQL |
| Host | Server hostname or IP address | localhost, 192.168.1.100 |
| Port | PostgreSQL server port | 5432 |
| Initial Database | Database to open on connection | postgres, mydatabase |
| Username | Authentication username | postgres, dbuser |
| Password | User password | (hidden) |
| Encoding | Client character set encoding | UTF-8, SQL_ASCII |
| Enable Keep Alive | Prevents disconnection due to idle timeout | Yes/No |
| Auto Connect | Automatically connect when starting Navicat | Yes/No |
| Timeout (seconds) | Database connection timeout setting | 30 |

## Testing the Connection

Before using a new connection, you should test it to ensure all settings are correct:

1. Click the **Test Connection** button in the connection dialog.
2. If the connection is successful, you'll see a "Connection Successful" message.
3. If the connection fails, Navicat will display an error message to help you diagnose the issue.

### Common Test Connection Errors:

- **Connection Refused**: PostgreSQL service may not be running or a firewall is blocking the connection.
- **Authentication Failed**: Incorrect username or password.
- **Initial Database Not Found**: The specified database doesn't exist.
- **Timeout**: The server couldn't respond within the specified time.

## Advanced Connection Options

Navicat offers various advanced connection options, accessible by clicking the **Advanced** tab:

1. **General Settings**:
   - **Connection Timeout**: Set the timeout in seconds for connection attempts.
   - **Execution Timeout**: Set the timeout in seconds for query execution.
   - **Keep Alive Interval**: Set the interval for sending keep-alive signals to the server.

2. **PostgreSQL-Specific Options**:
   - **Use System DSN**: Connect to a system data source name.
   - **OID Options**: Include object identifiers.
   - **Limit Single Connection**: Limit Navicat to create only one connection to the server.

3. **SQL Format Settings**:
   - Set SQL keyword capitalization format.
   - Configure identifier quoting method.

4. **Logging**:
   - Enable query logging to record all SQL operations.
   - Configure log file location.

## SSL Connection Configuration

To enhance security, you can configure SSL connection to PostgreSQL server:

1. In the connection dialog, switch to the **SSL** tab.
2. Select the **Use SSL** checkbox.
3. Configure SSL mode (require, verify-ca, verify-full).
4. If needed, provide SSL certificate files:
   - CA Certificate
   - Client Certificate
   - Client Key
   - Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify SSL settings.

## SSH Tunnel Connection

If the PostgreSQL server is behind a firewall or requires a secure tunnel for connection, you can use an SSH tunnel:

1. In the connection dialog, switch to the **SSH** tab.
2. Select the **Use SSH Tunnel** checkbox.
3. Fill in the SSH server information:
   - **Host**: The hostname or IP address of the SSH server.
   - **Port**: SSH port (default is 22).
   - **Username**: Username for the SSH server.
   - **Authentication Method**: Choose Password, Public Key, or Private Key authentication.
   - Depending on the chosen authentication method, provide the corresponding password or key files.

4. Click **Test Connection** to verify SSH tunnel settings.

### How SSH Tunnel Works

SSH tunnel creates an encrypted channel, working through these steps:

1. Navicat connects to the SSH server.
2. The SSH server creates a connection to the PostgreSQL server.
3. All data is transmitted through the encrypted SSH tunnel.

This method is particularly suitable for:
- Connecting to database servers not directly exposed on public networks.
- Scenarios requiring an additional security layer.
- Bypassing network restrictions (like firewall rules).

## Managing Multiple Connections

As the number of database connections increases, effectively managing them becomes important:

1. **Connection Grouping**:
   - Right-click on empty space in the connection window, select **New Group**.
   - Create meaningful groups (like "Development", "Testing", "Production").
   - Move connections to different groups by dragging and dropping.

2. **Connection Color Coding**:
   - Right-click a connection, select **Edit Connection**.
   - In the General tab, click the color square to set a color identifier for the connection.
   - Use different colors to distinguish between production/development environment connections.

3. **Export/Import Connection Settings**:
   - Select **File** > **Export Connections** to save connection configurations.
   - Use **File** > **Import Connections** to restore connections on different computers.

4. **Quick Connection Search**:
   - Use the search box at the top of the connection window to quickly find connections.

## Connection Troubleshooting

When connecting to PostgreSQL databases, you might encounter issues. Here are some common problems and solutions:

### Connection Refused

**Possible Causes**:
- PostgreSQL service is not running.
- Firewall is blocking the connection.
- pg_hba.conf is incorrectly configured.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the PostgreSQL service is running.
2. Verify if the firewall allows traffic on port 5432.
3. Check the pg_hba.conf file to ensure your IP address/subnet is allowed to connect.

### Authentication Failed

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect username or password.
- User doesn't have connection permissions.
- Password authentication method is incorrectly configured.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify if the username and password are correct.
2. Run in PostgreSQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT rolname, rolcanlogin FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'your_username';
   ```
3. Check if the authentication method in pg_hba.conf is compatible (md5, scram-sha-256, trust, etc.).

### Database Does Not Exist

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect initial database name.
- Database has been deleted.

**Solutions**:
1. Try connecting to the default `postgres` database.
2. After connecting, you can view available databases:
   ```sql
   SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
   ```

### SSL Connection Issues

**Possible Causes**:
- Incorrect SSL certificate path.
- Server not configured for SSL.
- Certificate verification failed.

**Solutions**:
1. Confirm the PostgreSQL server is configured for SSL (check for ssl = on in postgresql.conf).
2. Verify the path and permissions of certificate files.
3. Try using a lower SSL mode (like "require" instead of "verify-full") for testing.

### Connection Timeout

**Possible Causes**:
- Network issues.
- Server overload.
- Timeout setting too short.

**Solutions**:
1. Check network connection and latency.
2. Increase connection timeout setting.
3. For remote servers, try testing network connection using ping or telnet.

## Connection Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of database connections, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Strong Passwords**:
   - Set complex and unique passwords for database users.
   - Change passwords periodically.

2. **Use Dedicated Database Users**:
   - Avoid using the postgres superuser for regular connections.
   - Create dedicated users with minimal privileges for different applications.

3. **Enable SSL Encryption**:
   - Always use SSL connections in production environments.
   - Use "verify-ca" or "verify-full" mode to ensure connection security.

4. **Implement IP Restrictions**:
   - Restrict allowed IP addresses in pg_hba.conf.
   - Use subnet masks to limit connection range.

5. **Use SSH Tunnels**:
   - Consider using SSH tunnels for remote connections to provide an extra layer of security.
   - Avoid exposing database ports directly on public networks.

6. **Protect Connection Credentials**:
   - Avoid storing plaintext passwords in shared scripts or codebases.
   - Use Navicat's password management feature to securely store credentials.

7. **Regularly Audit Connections**:
   - Monitor and log database connection attempts.
   - Check for failed connection attempts that might indicate security issues.
