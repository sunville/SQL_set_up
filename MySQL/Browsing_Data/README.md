## The Data Viewer Interface

Navicat's Data Viewer is the primary tool for browsing and interacting with your data. It provides multiple viewing modes and powerful filtering capabilities.

### Opening the Data Viewer

1. In the Navicat main window, connect to your MySQL server
2. Navigate to your database in the connection tree
3. Expand the "Tables" node
4. Double-click on a table to open the Data Viewer
5. Alternatively, right-click on a table and select "Open Table" or "View Data"

### Understanding the Interface Components

The Data Viewer consists of several key areas:

1. **Toolbar**: Contains buttons for common operations like filtering, sorting, and changing view modes
2. **Grid/Form Toggle**: Switch between Grid (tabular) and Form (record) views
3. **Navigation Bar**: Move between pages of results and specific records
4. **Filter Panel**: Create and apply filters to your data
5. **Status Bar**: Shows record count and current selection information
6. **Data Grid/Form**: The main area displaying your data

## Browsing Table Data

### Grid View Navigation

Grid view displays data in a spreadsheet-like format:

1. **Paging through results**:
   - Use the navigation bar at the bottom of the window
   - Click the arrow buttons to move forward or backward
   - Enter a specific page number in the page field
   - Adjust records per page in Preferences or View menu

2. **Scrolling through data**:
   - Use the scrollbars to move horizontally or vertically
   - Mouse wheel for vertical scrolling
   - Shift+mouse wheel for horizontal scrolling

3. **Keyboard navigation**:
   - Arrow keys to move between cells
   - Page Up/Down to scroll vertically
   - Home/End to jump to first/last column
   - Ctrl+Home/End to jump to the first/last record

## Filtering and Searching Data

### Quick Filters

For rapid filtering of data:

1. Click the "Filter" button in the toolbar to show the filter row
2. Enter filter criteria in the cells below the column headers
3. Use operators and wildcards:
   - `=` equals (default if no operator specified)
   - `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for numeric comparisons
   - `*` or `%` as wildcards (e.g., `name*` finds all names starting with "name")
   - `|` for OR conditions (e.g., `John|Jane` finds records containing either "John" or "Jane")
   - `!` for NOT conditions (e.g., `!Smith` excludes records containing "Smith")
