## Connection Properties

### Essential Connection Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Host      | Server hostname or IP address | localhost |
| Port      | MySQL server port | 3306 |
| User Name | MySQL user account | root |
| Password  | User's password | (none) |
| Encoding  | Character encoding | utf8mb4 |
| Timeout   | Connection timeout in seconds | 30 |

### Understanding Connection Modes

Navicat offers different connection modes:

1. **Basic Connection**: Standard direct connection to a MySQL server
2. **SSH Tunnel**: Securely connect through an SSH server to a MySQL server
3. **SSL Connection**: Encrypted connection using SSL/TLS certificates
4. **HTTP Tunnel**: Connect through an HTTP server using Navicat's HTTP tunneling script

To change the connection mode:

1. Right-click on your connection in the sidebar
2. Select "Edit Connection"
3. Use the tabs at the top to switch between different connection modes

## Testing Your Connection

### Basic Connection Test

1. Create or edit a connection
2. Click the "Test Connection" button
3. Wait for the test to complete
4. Review the results

### Connection Diagnostics

If your connection test fails, Navicat provides diagnostic information:

1. Check the error message displayed after a failed connection test
2. Common errors include:
   - "Access denied": Incorrect username or password
   - "Host not found": Incorrect hostname or server not running
   - "Can't connect to MySQL server": MySQL service not running or firewall issues

### Verifying Connection Success

After establishing a connection:

1. The connection in the sidebar will display an "open" status
2. The database objects (tables, views, etc.) will be visible when expanding the connection
3. You can execute a simple query to verify functionality:
   ```sql
   SELECT VERSION();
   ```

## Managing Multiple Connections

### Organizing Connections

1. **Create Connection Groups**:
   - Right-click in the connection pane
   - Select "New Group"
   - Give the group a descriptive name (e.g., "Development Servers")
   - Drag and drop connections into the group

2. **Color-Coding Connections**:
   - Right-click on a connection
   - Select "Edit Connection"
   - Click the color box next to the connection name
   - Choose a color to identify the connection type (e.g., red for production)

### Connection Settings Management

1. **Export Connection Settings**:
   - Right-click on a connection
   - Select "Export Connection"
   - Choose a file location and name
   - The settings will be saved as a `.ncx` file

2. **Import Connection Settings**:
   - Click "Connection" in the top menu
   - Select "Import Connections"
   - Browse to the `.ncx` file
   - Select which connections to import

3. **Duplicate a Connection**:
   - Right-click on an existing connection
   - Select "Duplicate Connection"
   - Modify the settings as needed
   - Click "OK" to save the new connection

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### Common Connection Problems

#### Error 1045: Access Denied

**Issue**: Incorrect username or password

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your username and password
2. Ensure the user has appropriate privileges
3. Check if the user is restricted to specific hosts

#### Error 2003: Can't Connect to MySQL Server

**Issue**: Server not running or network issue

**Solutions**:
1. Verify MySQL service is running
2. Check firewall settings
3. Ensure the correct port is specified
4. Ping the server to check network connectivity

#### Error 2026: SSL Connection Error

**Issue**: SSL configuration mismatch

**Solutions**:
1. Verify SSL certificates are valid
2. Check if server requires SSL
3. Ensure proper SSL mode is selected in Navicat

### Connection Checklist

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. **Verify Server Status**:
   - Ensure MySQL is running
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Check Network Connectivity**:
   - Ping the server: `ping hostname`
   - Verify port accessibility: `telnet hostname 3306`

3. **Validate Credentials**:
   - Test credentials on command line:
     ```
     mysql -u username -p -h hostname
     ```

4. **Review Firewall Settings**:
   - Check Windows Firewall
   - Check cloud platform firewall rules
   - Verify network security groups

5. **Inspect MySQL Permissions**:
   - Verify user exists:
     ```sql
     SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
     ```
   - Check user privileges:
     ```sql
     SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'hostname';
     ```

## Connection Security

### Secure Connection Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**:
   - Create complex, unique passwords
   - Store passwords securely in Navicat's password manager

2. **Implement SSL/TLS**:
   - Enable SSL connections for all production databases
   - Verify certificate authorities for maximum security

3. **Utilize SSH Tunneling**:
   - Connect through SSH for added security
   - Set up public key authentication

4. **Restrict Access by IP**:
   - Limit MySQL users to specific IP addresses
   - Create different users for different connection sources

### Setting Up SSH Tunnel Connection

For enhanced security when connecting to remote servers:

1. In the connection dialog, switch to the "SSH" tab
2. Check "Use SSH Tunnel"
3. Enter SSH server details:
   - **Host**: SSH server hostname or IP
   - **Port**: SSH port (default: 22)
   - **User Name**: SSH username
   - **Authentication Method**: Password or Public Key
4. If using Public Key:
   - Specify the private key file path
   - Enter the passphrase if required
5. Click "OK" to save settings
